        <h1 class="title">Project Blue Beam - Everything You Need To Know (The Definitive Guide to PBB regarding US, Alaskan and Canadian UFO's and Chinese Surveillance Balloons in 2023)</h1>
        
        <p>In this post I will explain Project Blue Beam: where it started, what it is, and where we stand with it now. Many theorists call it the <strong>'fake alien invasion'</strong> that is being planned by the elites in an attempt to produce a final <strong>one-world government</strong>. In this post I will explain the origination of the theory and where we stand with it today. Many of it seems crazy, some of it, not so crazy. Please allow me to explain.</p>

        <p>Everything in this post is as objective as possible and I have done my best to avoid speculating and stick as closely as possible to the truth. Please be aware that I am not trying to push this theory as being 100% true, but rather to explain to people exactly what it is, why the theory holds weight and why things that are happening right now, do seem to support the theory.</p>

        <p>The theory these days tends to be held as a theory of the elite planning to produce a one-world government through the efforts of a fake-alien invasion. The fake-alien invasion is assumed to bring the worlds governments together fighting one common enemy (the aliens) which will finally end in the defeat of the enemy and the unification of the one-world government. But the original theory is much more complicated and elaborate than that... so I will explain everything in detail.</p>

        <p><strong>Project Blue Beam</strong> is a conspiracy theory which was theorised in the 80s and 90s that NASA (or another covert government-related agency) has been planning to implement a <strong> New-Age religion </strong> with the <strong> Anti-Christ </strong> as the leader - and to start a New World Order via a technologically-simulated Second-Coming <strong> using holograms</strong>. The allegations were first theorised in 1994 by journalist Serge Monast and later published in his book <em>(which is now almost impossible to obtain)</em>.</p>

        <p>The book was <em> called Project Blue Beam (NASA) </em> and supporters of the theory allege that Monast and another unnamed journalist, who both died of heart attacks in 1996, were in fact assassinated, and that the Canadian government kidnapped Monast's daughter in an effort to stop him from investigating Project Blue Beam.</p>

        <p>In the early 1990s, Monast spoke to the French TV host, Richard Glenn, of Ésotérisme Expérimental and he explained his theory, <strong> Project Blue Beam: </strong></p>

            <ol>

                <li>It explains how events that were happening at the time, particularly films being made <em>(Space Odyssey, Star Wars, Star Trek, etc) </em> were being used to prepare people psychologically for the conspiracy's dramatic conclusion. <strong> A fake alien invasion </strong>.</li>

                <li>It originally played on fears of alleged advanced technology that most people at the time, including its author, did not understand. Although now, <strong> 30 years later in 2023 </strong> , we can fully comprehend.</li>

            </ol>
    
        <p> The theorist's death from a <strong> supposed middle-age heart attack (although perfectly healthy) </strong> cut off its possible spread early and left it short on source-material in English (since the author was French and the internet was not available - people could not translate and share the theory.. until now..) </p>
            
        <p>If we look deeper into the theory today, we realise that a lot of what he said does seem to make sense, whilst some of it seems absurd. Allow me to elaborate:</p>   
    
             <h2>Propagation:</h2> 
        
                 <p>The theory was widely popular in the 90s, with many web pages in the 00s dedicated to the subject and countless Youtube videos explaining it (which have now unsurprisingly mostly been censored by Google and YouTube).</p>
        
                <p>Monast lectured on the theory in the mid-1990s (a transcript of one such lecture is available with enough digging), before writing and publishing his book, which has not been reissued by his current publisher and is extremely hard to find. However, a three-page summary of the theory, apparently penned by Monast himself, appeared in his French-language periodical <em> RINF (Réseau international de nouvelles par fax) </em> at the end of 1994. The scarce pages and videos all appear to trace back to four documents:</p>
    
                    <ol>

                        <li>A transcript of the 1994 lecture by Monast, translated into English.</li>
                        <li>A GeoCities page written by David Openheimer which appears to elaborate on the theories from the original book.</li>
                        <li>A page on educate-yourself.org compiled in 2005, which appears to include a translation of the book from French.</li>
                        <li>Monast's page in French Wikipedia. (The French Wikipedia article is largely sourced from two books on conspiracy theories and extremism by Pierre-André Taguieff, a mainstream academic expert on racist and extremist groups.)</li>
            
                    </ol>

    
        <p>From these few texts have come multiple off-shoot theories in text and video form, in several languages which people still refer to to this day. But here I will try my best to stick to the truth as much as possible. As with a lot of these things, a theory before it has happened is merely a theory. Before 9/11 happened, people theorised of a large terrorist event that would involve the deaths of thousands of people, happening in or around NYC. This post will serve in that similar detail, that it is merely a <strong> theory </strong> for the time being, until future events can ultimately prove it.</p>  
    
        <p>But, regardless if it is true or not, the text following is extremely strange and will make anyone with a conscious mind shudder:</p>

        <p> <em> Beyond a Pale Horse, William Coopers </em> book from 1991, has recently been considered to be a prophecy regarding Project Blue Beam to be used in the future as a reference to PBB build-up: </p>
    
        <p>It is true that without the population or the bomb problem the elect would use some other excuse to bring about the New World Order. They have plans to bring about things like <strong> earthquakes </strong> ,  war </strong>, the <strong> Messiah </strong> , an <strong> extra-terrestrial landing </strong>, and economic collapse. They might bring about all of these things just to make damn sure that it does work. They will do whatever is necessary to succeed. The Illuminati has all the bases covered and you are going to have to be on your toes to make it through the coming years.</p>
    
        <p>Can you imagine what will happen if <strong> Los Angeles is hit </strong> with a 9.0 <strong> [earth]quake, New York City is destroyed </strong> by a <strong> terrorist </strong> -planted atomic <strong> bomb [9/11], World War III breaks out in the Middle East [Western Invasion] </strong> , the <strong> banks and the stock markets collapse [20/01/23], Extra-terrestrials land on the White House lawn [PBB], food disappears from the markets [COVID] </strong> , some <strong> people disappear [Died Suddenly] </strong> , the  <strong> Messiah presents himself to the world [PBB] </strong> , and all in a very short period of time? Can you imagine? The world power structure can, and will if necessary, make some or all of those things happen to bring about the <strong> New World Order </strong> .</p>
    
    
            <h2>Step One</h2>   

                    <p>Step One requires the breakdown of all archaeological knowledge. This will apparently be accomplished by <strong> FAKING EARTHQUAKES [multiple earthquakes, 2023] </strong> at precise locations around the planet. These earthquakes will with them eventually present new information which will make us question our current belief-systems in regards to religion.</p>
    
                     <p> <strong> As most of you reading this will be aware, there have been multiple earthquakes recently, all of which seem to be happening at a much more frequent rate than usual. If PBB is correct, soon we will hear some sort of revelation in regards to new information coming to light regarding religious doctrine. Or perhaps it will be supressed... </strong></p>    

            <h2>Step two</h2>

                    <p>This is where it gets a bit crazy.</p>

                    <p>Airspace holograms will start off as subtle UFO but will eventually appear to people as <strong> <em> their God </em> </strong> .</p>

                    <p>This involves a large-scale hologram show where three-dimensional holographic laser projections will be beamed all over the planet — and this is where Blue Beam <em> really </em> starts. The projections will take the shape of <strong> <em> whatever deity is most predominant </em> </strong> , and will speak in all languages. <em> (Jesus in the US, Allah in the Middle East, etc) </em> At the end of this show, the gods will all merge into one god, the Antichrist. This will be the start of the New-Age religion.</p>

                    <p>Yes, I know, it seems crazy - stick with me. If you believe it's possible - read on. If you don't, then still read on, you'll learn something...</p>

                    <p>The notion of gods being projected into the sky was actually proposed before, in 1991 by conspiracy theorist Betty J. Mills And US general (CIA operative) Edward Landsdale, who actually suggested a plan to fake a Second Coming over Cuba... to get rid of Castro.</p>

                    <p>Consider the apparent tests over the years,</p>

                    <p>The  <strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSE1WdYngGA" target="_blank"> Chinese hologram of a flying city </a> </strong> 9/10/15.</p>
    
                    <p>The <strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV7S_df2l8A" target="_blank"> green beams in Milton Keynes </a> </strong> , UK 25/11/20</p>
    
                    <p>The <strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqyTuwMNs6s" target="_blank">Queens hologram </a> </strong> 05/06/22.</p>
    
                    <p>These all seem like possible staged events to test public reaction leading up to PBB. There are many more if you look hard enough - either way, it's apparent.. we now have the tech for convincing holograms to be projected into the sky and they're projecting convincing holograms into the sky.. if anyone was ever going to suggest PBB is happening, now would definitely be the time.</p>
                    
                    <p>Airspace holograms are definitely not unfathomable anymore...</p>

            <h2>Step Three</h2>     
                    
                    <p>Step Three is "Telepathic Electronic Two-Way Communication". It involves making people think their god is speaking to them through telepathy, projected into the head of each person individually using radio waves.</p>
                    
                    <p>With all the advances in technology today with regards to Elon Musk's brain-chip 'Neuralink' - this definitely seems more fathomable. In the coming years, Neuralink will be implemented, and this will make it much easier for the 'telepathic electronic two-way communication' - the exact same communication that Monast was speaking of in the 90s but that no one understood...</p>   
    
                    <p>But now, yes - it can <em> definitely </em> be understood..</p>
    
            <h2>Step Four</h2>         

                    <p>Step Four has three parts:</p>
                    
                    <ol >

                        <li class="step-four">Making humanity think an alien invasion is about to occur in every major city (which seems to have already started)</li>

                        <li class="step-four">Making the Christians think that the Rapture is about to happen (which also seems to have started)</li>

                        <li class="step-four">A mixture of electronic and supernatural forces, allowing the supernatural forces to travel through fibre optics, coax, power, and telephone lines to penetrate all electronic equipment and appliances that will, by now, 2023, all have a special microchip installed (5G).</li>

                    </ol>
    
    
        <P>Then chaos will break out, and people will finally be willing, perhaps even desperate, <strong> to accept the New World Order </P></strong>.</P>            
    
        <p>Project Blue Beam supporters believe psychological preparations have already been made, as previously mentioned in this post, Monast claimed that the films '' <strong> <em> 2001: A Space Odyssey', 'Star Wars' </em> </strong>, and the <strong> <em> 'Star Trek' </em> </strong> series all involve an invasion from space which ends ultimately in the coming together of countries to fight the common enemy <strong> (the fake alien invasion) also known as PBB </strong>.</p>            
    
        <p>This theory can also be further supported by the many recent films and series involving alien interference and invasion, <em> especially in the recent years between 10-23 </em>.</p>            
    
        <p>(Step Five - New World Order. See Bush SR's quote at the end of this post....)</p> 
                    
    
            <h2>The Prophecy</h2> 
                    <p>Joel Engel's book <em> Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek </em> explains of an <strong> unmade Star Trek film </strong> that seems to prophesise Project Blue Beam...</p>
                    
                    <p> <strong>"In May 1975, Gene Roddenberry accepted an offer from Paramount to develop Star Trek into a feature film, and moved back into his old office on the Paramount lot. His proposed story told of a flying saucer, hovering above Earth, that was programmed to send down people who looked like prophets, including Jesus Christ."</strong></p>
    
                    <p>So, it turns out that the basis of the conspiracy theory was in the <strong> UNMADE mid-'70s Star Trek film script by Roddenberry </strong>, which were recycled for the <em> Star Trek: The Next Generation episode Devil's Due </em>, broadcast in 1991 in which the false prophets had been redacted from the plot.</p>    
    
                    <p>In addition, believe it or not, Gene Roddenberry <strong> used to work for U.S military intelligence.... </strong></p>
            
            <h2>In Conclusion:</h2>        


                    <p>There is no evidence of deliberate fraud on Monast's part so how did he know exactly what the film script prophesised? The actual source was so obviously similar that even other conspiracy theorists noticed. They assumed that it was obvious that Monast had been fed information from the CIA, hence his apparent assassination in the 90's... This part of the story is very strange and no one is yet to come up with a credible theory as to why this happened, or how it happened.</p>

                    <p>So, how did this happen? Coincidence? Or the Illuminati doing what they're so good at doing? Prophesising events before they even happen? I think we all know, perhaps much too well, how this has happened before...</p>

                    <p>I will now break down the worlds current events which could certainly be used to support Monasts theory from the 90s, and not only explain the following events in the 00s and 10s but also explain the events of the 20s and most importantly, 2023...</p>



            <h2>Recent events</h2>    
            
            <h3>00s and 10s:</h3>

            <p>Multiple UFO sightings by the general public, not covered by MSM.</p>

            <h3>2021 & 2022:</h3>

            <p>A steady release of information from multiple MSM sources worldwide re UFO's, covered by MSM.</p>

            <p>The media start gradually drip-feeding us more information, accepting the fact that aliens [may] exist and that Roswell and Area 54 was real.</p>        

            <p>Joe Rogan and Netflix etc push the narrative of 'Tic Tac' UFO's - and that there are definitely UFO's in our airspace - even supported by Obama.</p>        

            <h3>Jan 28th 2023 (event #1, #2 & #3)</h3>        

            <p>A Chinese-operated, large white high-altitude 'surveillance balloon' was seen in North American airspace (event #1) including Alaska (event #2) , western Canada (event #3), and the contiguous United States, whilst in Hawaii, a giant wall of green lasers appeared to be shooting down from the sky. </p>        

            <h3>Feb 4th 2023:</h3>  
            
            <p>The Chinese 'surveillance balloon' is eventually shot down in US airspace (see event #1)</p>

            <h3>Feb 10th 2023:</h3>        

            <p>The US shoot down an "unidentified object" over Alaska (see event #2). (Described as cylindrical and grey in appearance.)</p>        

            <h3>Feb 11th 2023:</h3>       
                     
            <p>NORAD shoot down a 2nd "unidentified object" over Canada (see event #3). (Described as flying, but the shape of a car.)</p>        

            <h3>Feb 12th 2023:</h3>   
            
            <p>US shoots down a 3rd "unidentified object" over Lake Heron.</p>

            <h3>3 UFO's shot down in 3 days.....</h3>
            
            <h3>3 UFO's shot down in 3 days.....</h3>

            <p>So, based on our current knowledge, PBB is not proven, but has definitely been reinforced. There are multiple happenings which have not only been prophesised by PBB documentation, but that definitely seem to demonstrate and back it up. Are these merely coincidences? Or is something deeper afoot?</p>

            <p>Personally I believe that there is some truth in the theory, but the idea of prophets being projected into the sky seems to be outlandish. Is the truth more subtle? Will we experience holograms which will later be proved to simply be UFO's? Followed by aliens who claim to be Messiahs? What do you think is possibly going on?</p>       

            <p>I believe there is more to PBB than just being a crazy theory detailed by a Frenchman in the 90s - I certainly believe there is more to it. Projected Messiahs? I'm not so sure. But the recent happenings would definitely suggest something is going on. Exactly what? Only time will tell.</p>        

            <p>I suppose we will only find out the truth in due course. Thank you for reading, and I appreciate any input you may have.</p>        

            <p>Yours,</p>   
            
            <p> <strong> <em> u/Cantona </em> </strong></p>

    <h3>To Close:</h3>        

    <p>Below is a clip of Bush SR on September 11th 1991 referring to an event in which all nations will be drawn together in an effort to defeat one common enemy (took me ages to find) Many conspiracy theorists assume this is a reference to PBB, the 'fake alien invasion' - and it's hard to consider another scenario he could be referencing. 'All nations drawn together to defeat a common enemy' ??</p>

    <p>A very strange speech, for sure... (0:33</p>                

    <p>"What is at stake, is more than one small country - it is a big idea - a New World Order where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause.. to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind - peace and security, freedom and the rule of law.. out of these humble times, our fifth objective [Step Five?] - the New World Order - can emerge, [and] now we can see a new world coming into view. A world in which there is a very real prospect of a New World Order..."</p>

    <p>and I'll leave with you with this...</p>                

    <h3>Final Point:</h3>

    <p>Comments by Dr. Carol Rosin:</p>

    <p>“When I was a Corporate Manager of Fairchild Industries from 1974 through 1977, I met the late Dr. Wernher Von Braun. At that time, Von Braun was dying of cancer but he assured me that he would live a few more years to tell me about the game that was being played - that game being the effort to weaponize space, to control the Earth from space and space itself.”</p>

    <p>The next enemy was asteroids. Now, at this point he kind of chuckled the first time he said it. Asteroids- against ASTEROIDS we are going to build space-based weapons.</p>                

    <p>And the funniest one of all was what he called aliens, extraterrestrials. That would be the final scare. And over and over and over during the four years that I knew him and was giving speeches for him, he would bring up that last card. "And remember Carol, the last card is the alien card. We are going to have to build space-based weapons against aliens..... and all of it is a lie......."</p>
